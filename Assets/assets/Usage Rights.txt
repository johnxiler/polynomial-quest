You can use these files to make games to practice with.

I don't reccomend using them for commercial games. 
My tutorials are well known and the art is fairly recognizeable.

You *can* use them for this if you must, however.

Do NOT use them to create or release tutorial content. Free or otherwise.

Cheers!
